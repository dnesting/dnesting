## Who I Am

I am an engineering leader, with an emphasis in complex systems, resiliency, and solving problems.
My superpowers include working with empathy, communicating with non-technical leaders, and adapting.
I enjoy edge cases, adversarial thinking, and being hands-on.  My interests range from hacking electronics to
public policy.

## Qualifications

- Can effectively lead small and large teams, both short-term task forces and long-term product delivery
- Has run a CIO organization in the federal government, and is familiar with procurement, and relevant law
- Can design, build, and support modern large-scale systems that are available, scalable, and secure against common threats
- Can understand and troubleshoot complex information systems (Google, healthcare.gov), at all layers of the stack
- Can write efficient and readable code (Go and Python are my go-tos, but also C++, Java, bash)

Overview of active security clearances available on request.

## Experience

### The White House, Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
### [Office of the Federal CIO](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/)

**Cybersecurity Specialist** from 2024-2025:

- Senior advisor to the Federal CIO
- Policy analyst for AI, Cybersecurity, and IT Modernization

### [US Office of Personnel Management](https://www.opm.gov/)

**Deputy CIO** from 2019-2021:

- Stabilization of high-value assets.  Led a mainframe modernization activity to improve OPM's disaster preparedness and manage risk associated with multiple single points of failure.
- COVID-19 response.  Introduced the agency to modern collaboration tools, such as Zoom and Slack, to prepare the agency for extended majority-telework.
- Served as technology partner to the OPM CIO, focused on investigating the technology landscape at the agency and advising the CIO organization on risk, modern practices, and engineering
- Led a deep dive into call center issues resulting in disasterous customer experience, ultimately resulting in the formation of a cross-disciplinary team of 40 people all working on a cross-section of the problem from a process, self-help, and technology platform perspective.  Built a fully-functional, call-accepting reproduction of the call center using cloud tools in about 3 hours to disprove the belief that this was a multi-year level of effort.
- One time I had to build a Prometheus-based monitoring system from scratch in order to effectively troubleshoot a problem for which we had no visibility.
- One time I had to reverse engineer the agency's correspondence tracking system because it finally died and nobody knew how it worked and we needed the records out of it.
- Generally advise on cybersecurity

of "many terabytes" and the workload of thousands of analysis users consuming "many thousands" of
CPU cores.  Projects included:

- 24x7 on-call responsibilities, addressing problems ranging from network issues, failed roll-outs,
hardware faults (bad CPUs, RAM), misbehaving users, etc.

- Maintain and iterate on systems that ensure privacy commitments to our users were being met
(anonymization, retention limits, user-requested deletion, etc.)
- Maintain and iterate on systems that controlled access and made data available to authorized
analysis users
- Built a system to manage large cross-data center data migration efforts (at the petabyte scale)
- Built a system to preserve/segregate data subject to litigation

**Technical Architect** and similar roles, from 1999-2007 (8 years), on the production support team:

- Technical lead on the 24x7 operations team supporting www.att.com and similar sites
- Sole team member with development background, so I wrote a lot of tools and software to help
automate our work, and was the only team member who could meaningfully engage with the dev teams
to troubleshoot problems
- Significant role with AT&T's "shadow IT", spending a lot of time trying to make software engineering
suck less, given AT&T's engineering- and innovation-hostile corporate culture.
