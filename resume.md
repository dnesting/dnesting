## Who I Am

I enjoy edge cases and thinking at scale.  My interests range from hacking electronics to
public policy to leadership.

## Qualifications

- Can lead teams of engineers
- Can design, build, and support large-scale systems that are available, scalable, and secure against common threats.
- Can understand and troubleshoot complex information systems (Google, healthcare.gov), at all layers of the stack
- Can write efficient and readable code (Go and Python are my go-tos, but also C++, Java, bash)

TS/SCI

### Google

**Site Reliability Engineer** from 2007-2014 (7.5 years), on the logs infrastructure team, managing
all layers of the logs infrastructure, including hardware, OS, and service.  Supported data volumes
of "many terabytes" and the workload of thousands of analysis users consuming "many thousands" of
CPU cores.  Projects included:

- 24x7 on-call responsibilities, addressing problems ranging from network issues, failed roll-outs,
hardware faults (bad CPUs, RAM), misbehaving users, etc.
- Maintain and iterate on systems that ensure data integrity (strong assurances against tampering)
- Maintain and iterate on systems that ensure privacy commitments to our users were being met
(anonymization, retention limits, user-requested deletion, etc.)
- Maintain and iterate on systems that controlled access and made data available to authorized
analysis users
- Built a system to manage large cross-data center data migration efforts (at the petabyte scale)
- Built a system to preserve/segregate data subject to litigation
- Participated in efforts to reduce privileges and increase security of the infrastructure
- SRE hiring, conducting hundreds of engineering interviews

### AT&T

**Technical Architect** and similar roles, from 1999-2007 (8 years), on the production support team:

- Technical lead on the 24x7 operations team supporting www.att.com and similar sites
- Sole team member with development background, so I wrote a lot of tools and software to help
automate our work, and was the only team member who could meaningfully engage with the dev teams
to troubleshoot problems
- Significant role with AT&T's "shadow IT", spending a lot of time trying to make software engineering
suck less, given AT&T's engineering- and innovation-hostile corporate environment.

### Texas Networking, Inc.

**Engineer**, from 1995-1999 (approx.), as a member of the engineering staff.  This was a
small/startup regional ISP.

- Technical helpdesk, troubleshooting internet, networking, and client system problems
- Customer-facing documentation
- Writing small tools and internal servers to automate tasks, monitor infrastructure, etc.

## Education

Texas A&M, Computer Engineering major, 1998
