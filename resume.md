### SRE and Infrastructure Team Manager, [Rebellion Defense](https://rebelliondefense.com/), 2021-2023

Rebellion Defense is an AI-focused defense startup.

- Designed and built cloud (AWS, Kubernetes) infrastructure, tooling (Terraform) and software, and AI and novel infrastructure for Rebellion projects
- Managed a team of ~12 Site Reliability Engineers and Software Engineers
- Improve resiliency, maintainability, and operational support
- Kubernetes, GPUs, Go

### Deputy CIO, [US Office of Personnel Management](https://www.opm.gov/) 2019-2021

- Stabilization of high-value assets.  Led a mainframe modernization activity to improve OPM's disaster preparedness and manage risk associated with multiple single points of failure.
- COVID-19 response.  Introduced the agency to modern collaboration tools, such as Zoom and Slack, to prepare the agency for extended majority-telework.
- Served as technology partner to the OPM CIO, focused on investigating the technology landscape at the agency and advising the CIO organization on risk, modern practices, and engineering
- Led a deep dive into call center issues resulting in disasterous customer experience, ultimately resulting in the formation of a cross-disciplinary team of 40 people all working on a cross-section of the problem from a process, self-help, and technology platform perspective.  Built a fully-functional, call-accepting reproduction of the call center using cloud tools in about 3 hours to disprove the belief that this was a multi-year level of effort.
- One time I had to build a Prometheus-based monitoring system from scratch in order to effectively troubleshoot a problem for which we had no visibility.
- One time I had to reverse engineer the agency's correspondence tracking system because it finally died and nobody knew how it worked and we needed the records out of it.
- Generally advise on cybersecurity
