I am an engineering leader, with an emphasis in complex systems, reliability, resiliency, security, and solving problems.
My superpowers include working with empathy, communicating with non-technical leaders, and adapting.
I enjoy edge cases, adversarial thinking, and being hands-on.  My interests range from hacking electronics to
public policy.

## Qualifications

- Can effectively lead small incident response task forces and large product delivery teams
- Can understand, build, and troubleshoot complex systems at all layers of the stack
- Can design and build complex systems with reliability, security, and privacy in mind
- Can write efficient and readable code (Go, Python, others)

Overview of security clearances available on request.

## Experience

### Self-Employed, March 2025 - Present

- Artificial Intelligence and Software Defined Radio projects, public safety communications incident tracking, SDR orchestration on Kubernetes, AI agent workflow and orchestration
- Reliable and secure network design and deployment for a 30-unit residential building
- Guest Lecturer on Resiliency and Privacy Engineering for the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator

**Expert Witness, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), April-May 2025**

- Consulted on IT modernization, cybersecurity, and privacy
- Testified as an Expert Witness at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York

**Vega-Bray Observatory Rehabilitation, March 2025**

- Rehabilitated the Observatory's telescope, which had not seen light in 15 years
- Reverse engineered the dome control system and the telescope's drive and tracking system
- Built a custom hardware control system for the telescope's stepper motors, and wrote custom drive and tracking software in C/C++ (Arduino)

### Office of the Federal CIO, The White House (OMB), 2024-2025

**AI and Cybersecurity Advisor to the Federal CIO**

- AI, Cybersecurity, Reliability and Resiliency, and Technology Modernization policy and implementation advisor to the Federal CIO
- Artificial Intelligence Lead at OMB, collaborating heavily between IT, policy, records, and legal teams
- Built on-premise AI platform proof of concept and associated tooling, using Go and Kubernetes with NVIDIA H100 hardware.
- Technology Advisor to the OMB Chief Information Officer on AI, SRE/operations, data, cybersecurity, and modernization
- Led a cross-functional Technology Modernization Fund discovery effort and co-authored a $~100M modernization proposal

### Rebellion Defense, 2021-2023

**SRE and Infrastructure Team Manager**

- Ran the Site Reliability Engineering and Infrastructure team at Rebellion Defense, a startup building AI-powered defense software.
- 12 SREs and SWEs, mostly senior/staff level
- Platform was based on AWS, Kubernetes, and novel infrastructure
- This was a highly hands-on role, with ~50% of my work as an individual contributor

### US Office of Personnel Management, 2019-2021

**Deputy Chief Information Officer**

- Managed a ~750-person federal CIO organization with a $100M/year budget
- Led a mainframe modernization activity to improve OPM's resiliency against single points of failure
- Introduced modern collaboration tools, such as Zoom and Slack, to prepare the agency for extended COVID-19 telework
- Advised the CIO on security, risk, modern practices, resiliency, and engineering
- Led a deep dive into call center issues resulting in disasterous customer experience. Built a fully-functional, call-accepting reproduction of the call center using cloud tools in about 3 hours to disprove the belief that this was a multi-year level of effort
- One time I had to build a Prometheus-based monitoring system in Go in order to effectively troubleshoot a problem for which we had no visibility
- One time I had to reverse engineer the agency's correspondence tracking system because it finally died and nobody knew how it worked, wrote an entirely new system in Go to allow users to access their data and extract records for archival
